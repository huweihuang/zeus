// Base version information.
//
// This is the fallback data used when version information from git is not
// provided via go ldflags. It provides an approximation of the Kubernetes
// version for ad-hoc builds (e.g. `go build`) that cannot get the version
// information from git.
//
// If you are looking at these fields in the git tree, they look
// strange. They are modified on the fly by the build process. The
// in-tree values are dummy values used for "git archive", which also
// works for GitHub tar downloads.
